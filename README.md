# the-goldman-clause's Stumped Python 3 Client

This was my first place submission to [MegaMinerAI](http://siggame.io/blog/) 19: Stumped,
run by SIG-Game of Missouri University of Science and Technology. The only
real logic I added was in `games/stumped/ai.py`, although I did update
`games/stumped/tile.py` and `games/stumped/beaver.py` to allow for sorting
and hashing. The only changes I have made since the end of competition
are:

1. White space formatting.
2. Removal of a few unused functions.
3. Removal of some print statements and commented out code.
4. Added some comments to improve readability.
5. Completely rewrote `README.md`.
